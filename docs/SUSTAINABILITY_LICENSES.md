- 🤖 **Ethical Standards**: Particularly for AI systems and high-stakes applications
- 🏛️ **Democratic Governance**: Community participation and transparent decision-making
- ♻️ **Climate Action**: Measurable commitments to climate goals

### Purpose and Philosophy

These licenses represent a new approach to technology governance that recognizes software's broader impact on society and the planet. By embedding sustainability requirements into licensing terms, we create accountability beyond just code quality and legal compliance.

**Key Principles**:
- Technology should serve humanity and the planet
- Transparency and accountability in software development
- Measurable commitments to environmental and social goals
- Community-driven governance and decision-making
- Ethical AI development and deployment
- Climate action integrated into technology practices

## 🎯 Choosing the Right License

### Single License Approach

Choose the license that best aligns with your project's primary sustainability focus:

**Environmental Focus** → SUL-1.0 or EIL-1.0 or CAL-1.0
- SUL-1.0: If energy efficiency is primary concern
- EIL-1.0: If comprehensive lifecycle assessment is needed
- CAL-1.0: If climate impact and carbon accounting are critical

**Social Focus** → SBL-1.0
- Public benefit and accessibility are priorities
- Community impact is a core value
- Digital equity is a key goal

**Governance Focus** → CGL-1.0
- Democratic community management is essential
- Open-source collaboration is central
- Inclusive leadership is a priority

**AI/Technology Focus** → EAL-1.0
- Developing AI or ML systems
- Ethical considerations are paramount
- Fairness and transparency are critical

### Dual/Multiple License Approach

Combine licenses for comprehensive coverage:

**Common Combinations**:

1. **EAL-1.0 + CAL-1.0**: Climate-conscious AI projects
   - Example: Large language models with carbon accountability

2. **SBL-1.0 + CGL-1.0**: Community-focused open source
   - Example: Public sector platforms with democratic governance

3. **SUL-1.0 + EAL-1.0**: Sustainable AI development
   - Example: Edge AI optimized for efficiency and ethics

4. **EIL-1.0 + CAL-1.0**: Comprehensive environmental commitment
   - Example: Cloud platforms with full lifecycle and climate accountability

5. **All Six**: Maximum sustainability commitment
   - For flagship projects demonstrating complete commitment

### Combining with Traditional Open Source Licenses

Sustainability licenses are designed to work alongside traditional OSS licenses:

**Dual Licensing Structure**:

```
Primary License: MIT License (traditional IP/legal terms)
Additional License: SUL-1.0 (sustainability requirements)
```

**How It Works**:
- Traditional license (MIT, Apache, GPL) governs intellectual property
- Sustainability license adds environmental/social/ethical requirements
- Both must be complied with

**Example License Headers**:

```
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT AND SUL-1.0
```

or

```
Licensed under the MIT License and the Sustainable Use License (SUL-1.0).
See LICENSE-MIT.md and LICENSE-SUL.md for details.
```

## 🚀 Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your License(s)

Review the six licenses and select the one(s) that align with your project goals and values. Consider:
- Your project's primary purpose and impact
- Computational resource requirements
- Community and governance structure
- Social and ethical implications
- Environmental footprint

### Step 2: Add License Files

Copy the appropriate license file(s) from the [License Library](../licenses/):

```bash
# Single license
cp licenses/SUL-1.0.md YOUR_PROJECT/LICENSE-SUL.md

# Multiple licenses
cp licenses/EAL-1.0.md YOUR_PROJECT/LICENSE-EAL.md
cp licenses/CAL-1.0.md YOUR_PROJECT/LICENSE-CAL.md
```

### Step 3: Update README

Add a license section to your README:

```markdown
## License

This project is licensed under:
- MIT License - for intellectual property terms
- Sustainable Use License (SUL-1.0) - for sustainability requirements

See [LICENSE-MIT.md](LICENSE-MIT.md) and [LICENSE-SUL.md](LICENSE-SUL.md) for details.
```

### Step 4: Update Package Metadata

Add license information to your package files:

**package.json** (Node.js):
```json
{
  "license": "(MIT AND SUL-1.0)",
  "licenses": [
    {
      "type": "MIT",
      "url": "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"
    },
    {
      "type": "SUL-1.0",
      "url": "https://github.com/Violet-Site-Systems/.github/blob/main/licenses/SUL-1.0.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

**setup.py** (Python):
```python
setup(
    license="MIT AND SUL-1.0",
    classifiers=[
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "License :: Other/Proprietary License",
    ]
)
```

### Step 5: Document Compliance

Create a `SUSTAINABILITY.md` file documenting how you meet the license requirements:

```markdown
# Sustainability Compliance
